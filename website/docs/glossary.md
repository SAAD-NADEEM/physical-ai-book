# Glossary

This glossary defines technical terms used throughout the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course.

## A

### Action Space
The set of all possible actions that an agent can take in an environment.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

## B

### Behavior Tree
A mathematical model of plan execution used in robotics and AI to organize the process of switching between different tasks.

## C

### Computer Vision
A field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world.

## D

### Deep Learning
A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns.

## E

### Embodiment
The concept of grounding AI in physical form, allowing interaction with the real world.

## F

### Forward Kinematics
The use of joint parameters to compute the position and orientation of the end-effector of a robotic manipulator.

## G

### Gaussian Process
A stochastic process that assumes that any finite set of output values are jointly Gaussian with zero mean and some covariance matrix.

## H

### Humanoid Robot
A robot with a body shape similar to that of a human being.

## I

### Inverse Kinematics
Mathematical procedure for computing the joint parameters that achieve a specified position of the end-effector.

## L

### Lidar
A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of pulsed laser to measure distances.

## M

### Manipulator
A programmable mechanical device used to move and position objects in space.

## N

### Neural Network
A series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.

## P

### Path Planning
The process of determining a route through an environment from a start to a goal that avoids obstacles.

### Point Cloud
A collection of data points in a coordinate system, typically used to represent the external surfaces of objects.

## R

### Reinforcement Learning
A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties.

### Robot Operating System (ROS)
A flexible framework for writing robot software, providing a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions.

### ROS 2
The second generation of the Robot Operating System, providing improved security, reliability, and performance.

## S

### Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

## T

### Trajectory Planning
The process of creating a path that a robot will follow, including the timing and execution aspects.

## U

### Uncertainty Quantification
The process of characterizing and reducing uncertainties in both computational and real-world applications.

## V

### Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
A type of AI system that integrates visual perception, language understanding, and action execution capabilities.

## W

### Waypoint
A reference point for navigation or motion planning in robotics.
