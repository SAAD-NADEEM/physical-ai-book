## 📘 About This Book

This repository contains the complete documentation and technical materials for the **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics** graduate course. It serves as both a reference guide and comprehensive learning resource for students exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems.

### 🎯 Course Overview

This 13-week graduate course provides a deep understanding of the principles, technologies, and applications of physical AI, particularly in the context of humanoid robotics. The curriculum is divided into four interconnected modules:

#### **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** (Weeks 1-5)
- Introduction to ROS 2 architecture and middleware
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Launch files and parameter management
- Building and managing ROS 2 workspaces

#### **Module 2: Simulation Environments** (Weeks 6-7)
- Robotics simulation tools and platforms
- Gazebo and Ignition simulation environments
- Physics engines and sensor modeling
- Testing and validation in simulation

#### **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform** (Weeks 8-10)
- NVIDIA Isaac robotics development platform
- Isaac Sim for simulation and training
- Isaac ROS for perception and navigation
- Integration with NVIDIA GPU computing

#### **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Integration** (Weeks 11-13)
- Perception systems combining vision and other sensors
- Language understanding in robotic context
- Action execution and task planning
- Building integrated AI-robotic systems
