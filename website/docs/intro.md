# Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive 13-week graduate course on **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**. This course explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, with a focus on humanoid robotics applications.

## Course Overview

This course is designed to provide graduate students with a deep understanding of the principles, technologies, and applications of physical AI, particularly in the context of humanoid robotics. The curriculum spans 13 weeks and is divided into four interconnected modules:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** (Weeks 1-5)
2. **Module 2: Simulation Environments** (Weeks 6-7) 
3. **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform** (Weeks 8-10)
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Integration** (Weeks 11-13)

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Design and implement robotic systems using ROS 2
- Develop simulation environments for robot testing and training
- Deploy robotics applications on the NVIDIA Isaac platform
- Integrate vision, language, and action systems for complex robotic tasks
- Apply AI techniques to real-world robotic problems
- Evaluate and analyze the performance of robotic systems

### Prerequisites

Students should have:

- Strong programming skills in Python and C++
- Fundamentals of linear algebra and calculus
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Some exposure to robotics concepts is helpful but not required

### Course Structure

Each module builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and technologies while reinforcing previously learned material. The course combines theoretical foundations with practical implementation, requiring students to engage with real hardware and simulation environments.

### Assessment

Assessment in this course is based on:

- Module-specific projects (60%)
- Participation in class discussions (10%)
- Final capstone project integrating all modules (30%)
