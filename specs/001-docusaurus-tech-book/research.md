# Research for Docusaurus-based Technical Book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

## Research Task: Docusaurus v3.x Setup Commands via Context7 MCP
**Decision:** Need to research and retrieve the official Docusaurus v3.x setup commands using Context7 MCP
**Rationale:** The constitutional requirement mandates using context7 MCP for all Docusaurus setup tasks to ensure best practices and official guidance.
**Alternatives considered:** Manual setup without MCP tools, but rejected as it violates the constitutional requirement to use context7 MCP.
**Finding:** The standard Docusaurus initialization command is `npx create-docusaurus@latest website classic`, but the MCP must confirm current best practices.

## Research Task: GitHub Pages Deployment Configuration for docusaurus.config.js
**Decision:** Need to research proper GitHub Pages configuration values using Context7 MCP
**Rationale:** Using Context7 MCP ensures compliance with deployment best practices and official guidance.
**Alternatives considered:** Hardcoding deployment values without MCP verification, but rejected as it violates the constitutional requirement.
**Finding:** GitHub Pages deployment requires specific fields in docusaurus.config.js including organizationName, projectName, and deploymentBranch.

## Research Task: Search Plugin Configuration (Algolia vs Local)
**Decision:** Need to determine the best search plugin option based on project requirements
**Rationale:** Context7 MCP will provide guidance on whether Algolia or local search is best for a technical book.
**Alternatives considered:** Choosing based on internal knowledge without verification, but rejected due to constitutional requirement.
**Finding:** Docusaurus v3 includes local search plugin by default which may be sufficient, but Algolia offers more powerful features.

## Research Task: Code Examples Environment Setup for ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, and VLA
**Decision:** Need to research proper setup environment for technical content
**Rationale:** Using Context7 MCP ensures accurate and validated configurations for these specialized tools.
**Alternatives considered:** Using general knowledge without MCP verification, but rejected as it violates the constitutional requirement.
**Finding:** Each system (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, VLA) has specific environment requirements that need to be confirmed through official documentation.
