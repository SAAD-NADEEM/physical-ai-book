- Week 1: Introduction to ROS 2 and Robot Architecture
- Week 2: Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions
- Week 3: Robot Manipulation and Control
- Week 4: Navigation and Path Planning
- Week 5: Multi-Robot Systems and Coordination

### Module 2: Simulation Environments (Weeks 6-7)
- Week 6: Physics Simulation with Gazebo
- Week 7: Unity Integration and Visual Simulation

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform (Weeks 8-10)
- Week 8: Introduction to Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
- Week 9: Perception and Sensing with Isaac
- Week 10: Navigation and Manipulation Frameworks

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Integration (Weeks 11-13)
- Week 11: Vision-Language Models for Robotics
- Week 12: Action Generation and Execution
- Week 13: Capstone Project Integrating All Modules

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Design and implement robotic systems** using the Robot Operating System (ROS 2)
2. **Create and evaluate simulation environments** for robot testing and training
3. **Deploy robotics applications** on the NVIDIA Isaac platform
4. **Integrate vision, language, and action systems** for complex robotic tasks
5. **Apply AI techniques** to real-world robotic problems
6. **Evaluate and analyze** the performance of robotic systems

## Assessment Methods

- **Module Projects (60%)**: Each module will have an associated project demonstrating practical application of concepts.
- **Participation (10%)**: Active participation in class discussions and peer reviews.
- **Final Capstone Project (30%)**: A comprehensive project integrating all modules.

## Required Materials

- Access to a computer capable of running ROS 2, Gazebo, and Unity
- Recommended textbook: "Robotics, Vision and Control" by Peter Corke
- Access to NVIDIA Isaac platform (provided during course)
- Various open-source robotics libraries and frameworks

## Course Policies

### Late Assignment Policy
Late assignments will be penalized 10% per day, with a maximum of 3 days allowed for late submissions.

### Academic Integrity
All work must be original, with proper attribution given to external sources. Collaboration is encouraged for learning, but individual assignments must be completed independently.

### Participation
Students are expected to actively participate in discussions, both online and in-person where applicable.
