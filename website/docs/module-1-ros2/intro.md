# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course. This module covers the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the foundational middleware for most robotics applications. Over the next five weeks, you will learn to design, implement, and deploy robotic systems using ROS 2.

## Module Overview

This module introduces you to ROS 2, the next generation of the Robot Operating System, designed to address the limitations of ROS 1 while providing enhanced features like improved security, reliability, and support for real-time applications. You will learn about the architecture of ROS 2, its core components, and how to build distributed robotic applications.

### Duration
Weeks 1-5 of the course

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the architecture of ROS 2 and the role of DDS in communication
- Create ROS 2 nodes in both Python and C++
- Implement different communication patterns (topics, services, actions)
- Configure and use ROS 2 tools for debugging and visualization
- Build a complete multi-node robotic application

### Prerequisites
- Basic programming skills in Python and C++
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts
- Familiarity with command-line tools

## Module Structure

This module is divided into five chapters, each covering essential aspects of ROS 2:

1. **Chapter 1**: Introduction to ROS 2 and Robot Architecture
2. **Chapter 2**: Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions
3. **Chapter 3**: Robot Manipulation and Control
4. **Chapter 4**: Navigation and Path Planning
5. **Chapter 5**: Multi-Robot Systems and Coordination

Each chapter includes theoretical foundations, practical implementation examples, and exercises to reinforce your understanding.

## Getting Started

To get started with this module, you'll need to install ROS 2 and set up your development environment. The recommended version is [ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/) which is an LTS (Long Term Support) version that provides stability and long-term maintenance.

### Installation Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (recommended) or Windows 10/11 with WSL2
- At least 4GB RAM and 20GB of free disk space
- Internet connection for package downloads

In the next chapter, we'll explore the ROS 2 architecture in detail and set up your development environment.
